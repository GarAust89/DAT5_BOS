* Check for proper setup of Git by forking the [data science project examples](https://github.com/bbalin12/DAT-project-examples.git) and pulling the fork to your local hard drive.
* Download the following for Class 4:
	* [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/download.html).  Please make sure to download the precompiled binaries for your OS, NOT the source code.

* The SELECT statement
* The WHERE clause
* ORDER BY
* LEFT JOIN and INNER JOIN
* GROUP BY
* DISTINCT
* CASE statements

**Homework:** 
* Complete the in-class excercises, if you haven't already:
	* Find the player with the most at-bats in a single season.
	* Find the name of the the player with the most at-bats in baseball history.
	* Find the average number of at_bats of players in their rookie season.
	* Find the average number of at_bats of players in their final season for all players born after 1980. 
	* Find the average number of at_bats of Yankees players who began their second season at or after 1980.
	* Pass the SQL in the previous bullet into a pandas DataFrame and write it back to SQLite.


* Create full, working queries to answer at least four novel questions you have about the dataset using the following concepts:
	* The WHERE clause
	* ORDER BY
	* LEFT JOIN and INNER JOIN
	* GROUP BY
	* SELECT DISTINCT
	* CASE statements
	* Subqueries and IS NOT NULL

* Using Pandas, (1) query the Baseball dataset, (2) transform the data in some way, and (3) write a new table back to the databse.

* Commit and Sync your SQL and Pandas files to your GitHub fork and issue a pull request.

### Class 5: Supervised Learning and Model Evaluation
[slides](slides/05_ml_knn.pdf)
* Overview of machine learning
* Supervised vs unsupervised learning
* Classification with K-nearest meighbors
* Training and test sets
* K-fold cross validation
* Tuning model paramaters via grid search

**Homework (due 2/10):** 
* Build a preditive model that predicts whether a player was inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame before 2000 using their batting, pitching, and fielding results- not the number of those they received.  Please make sure to use K-fold cross validaiton and grid search to find your optimal mode. 
* Begin thinking about your class project.  It can be from anywhere you want -- your work, school or general interest. 

### Class 6: Linear Regression
[slides](slides/06_linear_regression.pdf)
* Overview of regression models
* Estimating linear regression coefficients
* Determining model relevance
* Interpreting model coefficients
* Gotchas
* Categorical features

**Homework (due 2/10):** 
* Using the Baseball dataset, build a linear regression model that predicts how many runs a player will have in a given year.
	* Begin with more than one possible model; each of which should have at least one categorical dummy feature and at least two continuous explanatory features.
	* Make sure you check for heteroskedasticity in your models.
	* Decide whether to include or take out the model's features depending on whether they may be collinear or insignificant. 
	* Interpret the model's coefficients and intercept.
	* Calculate the models' R-squared and in-sample RMSE.
	* Make sure to use a holdout group or k-fold CV to calculate out-of-sample RMSE for your model group.
	* Decide on the best model to use, and justify why you made that choice.
