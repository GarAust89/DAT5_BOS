### Installation and Setup
* Install the [Anaconda distribution](http://continuum.io/downloads) of Python 2.7x.
* Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
* Once you receive an email invitation from [Slack](https://slack.com/), join our "datbos05 team" and add your photo!


### Class 1: Introduction
* Introduction to General Assembly
* Course overview: our philosophy and expectations ([slides](slides/01_course_overview.pdf))
* Data science overview ([slides](slides/01_intro_to_data_science.pdf))
* Tools: check for proper setup of Anaconda, overview of Slack

**Homework:**
* Resolve any installation issues before next class.

**Optional:**
* Review the [code](code/00_python_refresher.py) for a recap of some Python basics.
* Read [Analyzing the Analyzers](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/radarreport/0636920029014/Analyzing_the_Analyzers.pdf) for a useful look at the different types of data scientists.
* Check out the [PyData Boston Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/PyData-Boston/) to become acquainted with the local data community.


### Class 2: Python & Pandas
[slides](slides/02_python_in_data_science.pdf)
* Brief overview of Python
* Brief overview of Python environments: Python scripting, IPython interpreter, Spyder
* Working with data in Pandas
    * Loading and viewing data
    * Indexing and selecting data
    * Assigning, reassigning, and splitting data
    * Describing and summarizing data
    * Plotting data

**Homework:**
* Do the [class homework](https://github.com/justmarkham/DAT4/blob/master/homework/05_pandas.md) by Tuesday.
* Read through the [project page](project.md) in detail.
* Review a few [projects from past Data Science courses](https://github.com/justmarkham/DAT-project-examples) to get a sense of the variety and scope of student projects.

**Optional:**
* If you need more practice with Python, review the "Python Overview" section of [A Crash Course in Python](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/rpmuller/5920182), work through some of [Codecademy's Python course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python), or work through [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/) and its exercises.
* For more project inspiration, browse the [student projects](http://cs229.stanford.edu/projects2013.html) from Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning course](http://cs229.stanford.edu/) at Stanford.

**Resources:**
* [Online Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/) is useful for visualizing (and debugging) your code.
